Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. student in Human Development in the School of Education at the University of California, Irvine. I work with [Dr. Drew Bailey](https://sites.uci.edu/dhbailey/) and [Dr. Andres Bustamante](https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=6446). I am passionate about child development, educational interventions, math education, and meta-science (meta-analysis and causal inference).

I hold a master's degree in Human Development from the Graduate School of Education at the Univeristy of Pennsylvania where I primarily worked with Dr. Sharon Wolf on the Quality of Preschool for Ghana project.
